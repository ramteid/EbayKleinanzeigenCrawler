.NET 6 based crawler that parses Ebay Kleinanzeigen classified ads and notifies via a Telegram Bot.

# Features:

* Specify a subscription by simply copying the URL from your browser
* Uses Telegram as interface for notifications and control
* Supports multiple Subscribers and Subscriptions
* You can easily add different interfaces (Console, E-Mail, SMS, ...)
* Persists data in JSON files

# Before use:
* Create your own Telegram Bot
* Set the environment variable `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` to your token. 

# How to use:
* Send /help to the Telegram bot for instructions
* Currently only works with Desktop-Browser links, not mobile browser links. (https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de/....)
* Ebay Kleinanzeigen obfuscates its HTML with JavaScript, when more than 40 queries are made within the last 5 minutes. This software considers this limit.
* This software is work in progress. There are many TODOs in the code. Feel free to contribute :-)

# Developing within a VSCode Devcontainer
* Download the VSCode Extension [Remote Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
* Create a `.env`-file in the repository root and set the variable `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<TOKEN>` if you don't want to set it manually later
* Open the Command Palette via View â†’ Command Palette or using the shortcut `CTRL + SHIFT + P`
* Run Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container (Rebuild and Reopen at the initial startup)
* If you haven't setup the Telegram Token environment variable using a `.env`-file, enter `export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<TOKEN>` into the console
* Change directory into `EbayKleinanzeigenCrawler` and start the project with `dotnet run` or `dotnet run --watch`
